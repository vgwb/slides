# Game based learning
an introduction

by Video Games Without Borders

<!-- slide -->

Game based learning (GBL) is a type of _game play_ that has _defined learning outcomes_. 

**Digital** game based learning (DGBL) refers to using actual digital video games as learning tools.

<!-- slide -->
# GBL is NOT gamification
Game-based learning should not be confused with gamification.

Gamification takes an element of education and replaces it with a game-based element. For instance, a teacher may replace grades with levels or experience points.

<!-- slide -->
# VideoGame types:
several types of games may be used in digital game-based learning:

- **Educational Games**: use an engaging and immersive learning experience to deliver specified learning goals, outcomes and experiences.
- **Online Games**: range from simple text-based games to games that span complex, virtual worlds used by large numbers of players simultaneously.
- **Serious Games**: train or educate users; generally, serious games have a primary purpose other than entertainment.
- **Simulations**: model real-world situations.

<!-- slide -->

# DGBL Domains
- Language Learning
- Mathematics and Science (STEM)
- Social Studies and History
- Development of Cognitive Skills

<!-- slide -->
# Principles
- Intrinsic motivation: playing is voluntary and self-driven
- Learning through enjoyment and "fun"
- Authenticity: contextualised, goal oriented instead of abstract learning
- Self-reliance and autonomy: passions and interests that lead to a will to specialize
- Experiential learning: learning by doing

<!-- slide -->
## Mechanisms
- Rules: simple and binary (e.g. if/then) or requiring more complex decision making
- Clear but challenging goals
- A fictional setting or "fantasy"
- Progressive difficulty levels
- Interaction and high degree of student control
- Immediate and constructive feedback
- A social element that allows people to share experience and build bonds

<!-- slide -->
# Videogames
Computer games are possibly the most engaging pastime in the history of mankind. These games bring together combination of motivating elements not found together in any other medium.
**Games**:
- are a form of fun -> _enjoyment and pleasure_
- are a form of play -> intense and passionate _involvement_
- are rules -> _structure_
- are goals -> _motivation_
- are interactive -> _doing_
- are adaptive -> _flow_
- have outcomes and feedback -> _learning_
- have a win state -> ego _gratification_
- have conflict/competition/challenge/opposition -> _adrenaline_
- have problem solving -> sparks _creativity_
- have interaction -> _social groups_
- have characters and story -> _emotion_

## 36 Learning principles in VideoGames
| | |
|---|---|
|1. Active, Critical Learning Principle |_All aspects of the the learning environment are set up to encourage active and critical, not passive, learning_|
|2. Design Principle | _Appreciating good design_ |
|3. Semiotic Principle  | _Seeing interrelations within and across multiple sign systems (images, words, actions, symbols, artifacts, etc.) as a complex system is core to the learning experience_ |
|4. Semiotic Domains Principle | _Mastering game languages and participation in the affinity groups connected to them_ |
|5. Metalevel Thinking About Semiotic Domains Principle | _Relating the game world to other worlds_|
|6. "Psychosocial Moratorium" Principle | _Taking risks with reduced consequences_|
|7. Committed Learning Principle | _Putting out effort because they care_|
|8. Identity Principle | _Combining multiple identities_|
|9. Self-Knowledge Principle | _Watching their own behaviour and their current and potential capacities_|
|10. Amplification Of Input Principle | _For a little input, learners get a lot of output_|
|11. Achievement Principle | _intrinsic rewards from the beginning, customised to each learner's level, effort, and growing mastery and signaling the learner's ongoing achievements_|
|12. Practice Principle | _Being encouraged to practice in a context where the practice is not boring_|

<!-- slide vertical=true -->

|  |  |
|---|---|
|13. Ongoing Learning Principle | _Having to master new skills at each level, with cycles of new learning, automatization, undoing automatization, and new re-organized automatization_|
|14. "Regime Of Competence" Principle | _Tasks being neither too easy nor too hard._|
|15. Probing Principle | _Learning is a cycle of probing the world (doing something); reflecting in and on this action and, on this basis, forming a hypothesis; reprobing the world to test this hypothesis; and then accepting or rethinking the hypothesis_|
|16. Multiple Routes Principle | _There are multiple ways to make progress or move ahead. This allows learners to make choices, rely on their own strengths and styles of learning and problem-solving, while also exploring alternative styles_|
|17. Situated Meaning Principle | _Discovering meaning of signs (words, actions, objects, artifacts, symbols, texts, etc.) situated in embodied experience_|
|18. Text Principle | _Texts are not understood purely verbally but are understood in terms of embodied experience_|
|19. Intertextual Principle | _Relating information_|
|20. Multimodal Principle | _Meshing information from multiple media (images, texts, symbols, interactions, abstract design, sound, etc.), not just words_|
|21. "Material Intelligence" Principle | _Understanding how knowledge is stored in material objects and the environment_|
|22. Intuitive Knowledge Principle | _Intuitive or tacit knowledge built up in repeated practice and experience. Not just verbal and conscious knowledge is rewarded_|
|23. Subset Principle | _Practicing in a simplified setting_|

<!-- slide vertical=true -->

|  |  |
|---|---|
|24. Incremental Principle | _Being led from easy problems to harder ones_ |
|25. Concentrated Sample Principle | _Mastering upfront things needed later_ |
|26. Bottom-Up Basic Skills Principle | _Repeating basic skills in many games_ |
|27. Explicit Information On-Demand Just-In-Time Principle | _Receiving information just when it is needed_ |
|28. Discovery Principle | _Experiments and Trying rather than following instructions_ |
|29. Transfer Principle | _Applying learning from problems to later ones_ |
|30. Cultural Models About The World Principle | _Thinking about the game and the real world_ |
|31. Cultural Models About Learning Principle | _Thinking about the game and how they learn_ |
|32. Cultural Models About Semiotic Domains | _Thinking about the games and their culture_ |
|33. Distributed Principle | _Meaning/knowledge is distributed across the learner, objects, tools, symbols, technologies, and the environment_ |
|34. Dispersed Principle | _Sharing knowledge with others outside the domain/game_ |
|35. Affinity Group Principle | _Being part of the gaming world and affinity groups bonded by the game and not shared race, gender, nation, ethnicity, or culture_ |
|36. Insider Principle | _Helping others and modifying games, in addition to just playing_ |

# Characteristics of good games
- FUN
- Age appropriate
- A **safe environment** to explore and in which to **make mistakes**
- Collaboration and competition
- Interaction and realtime feedback
- Appropriate challenge, gradually increasing difficulty
- Clear, achievable goals, rules, measurable outcomes and rewards

<!-- slide -->

# Procedure

- introduction to videogame (+coach: tech + expectations)
- gameplay / experience (autonomous)
- game results / scores
- reflection / analysis (+coach)
- forming abstract concepts + real world application

<!-- slide -->

# Coach Skills
- ICT / Basic Digital Skills
- Minimal game playing experience
- Deep understanding of how a game can help learning and its differences with a  classic book/course
- Recognise different players skills and support their game play
- Engage students in playing and progression

<!-- slide -->

# Coach Responsibilities:
- provide and explain the technology
- Match with curriculum – gaming outcomes and learning outcomes
- Time available, location, resources
- Associated activities, briefing, debriefing
- Building in reflection and collaboration
- DGBL terminology
- How to choose and introduce a game 
- How to help and stimulate engagement
- How to customise lesson pacing and clear expectations
- How to debrief a game session
- How to evaluate the outcomes

<!-- slide -->

# Assessment
Using games for assessment is about more than games scores. 

One of the most common misconceptions is that all good learning games must assess learners within the game.
The truth is that assessment happens around a game more often than it happens inside the game, and teachers must still design and provide authentic, useful assessment tasks for students.

# Development options

- Use entertainment/commercial games (Assassin Creed / Civilization)
- Modify entertainment games ()
- Use virtual worlds (Minecraft)

# GBL Limitations
**Curriculum**: identify how a certain game would connect to the curriculum. Difficulty with integrating the play of the game into the time structure of the day.

**Game related**: identify the accuracy and appropriateness of the content of the game. Irrelevant or distracting content from the game that could not be removed.

**Attitudes**: persuading all stakeholders about the value of the game.

**Teacher support**: Lack of available time for teachers to learn the game and generate best practices with it. Lack of specific training and support on the effective use of games in the classroom.

**Assessment**: Traditional assessments do not often align with GBL, so new models and approaches must be considered.

<!-- slide -->

# DGBL challenges

- convince non-users of games of their educational value
- encourage and support game developers in the creation of better educational games
- make educators aware of how to use games more effectively in education
